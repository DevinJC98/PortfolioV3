          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Devin. A 27 year old designer based out of Calgary, AB.
            After working in restaurants for almost a decade I decided to change
            careers and enrolled in SAIT's Interactive Design Diploma program.
            Today I'm working hard to pursue a career in design, making as much
            cool stuff as i can along the way.

          <h2>Skål Tavern</h2>
          <p>
            One of my early design projects involved creating a visual identity
            for a fictional restaurant named Skål Tavern. What began as sketches
            in my notebook grew into multiple logo variations, a brand guide,
            and menu design mockups. I used Adobe Illustrator and InDesign to
            build the brand, with a focus on clarity, consistency, and visual
            storytelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            This concept was shaped by nearly a decade of experience in the
            restaurant industry, as well as my travels through Scandinavia and a
            deep appreciation for the fantasy genre. Skål Tavern reflects the
            kind of restaurant I would open, warm, abundant, and rooted in
            comfort and hospitality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although this project was primarily focused on graphic design, it
            became a valuable opportunity for me to develop practical skills I
            continue to apply in web design, such as iterative design,
            typography, and iconography.

          <h2>Three.js Solar System</h2>
          <p>
            During one of my classes at SAIT I was tasked with exploring
            emerging tech. For this assignment I chose Three.js, JavaScript
            Library for building 3d experiences in browsers. I wanted to expand
            my knowledge of JavaScript libraries as well as challenge myself by
            building a basic 3D enviroment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I decided to recreate our solar system, as I
            believed it would serve as a compelling and structured way for me to
            learn the fundamentals of 3D development. This included concepts
            such as geometry, lighting, texture mapping, and camera controls,
            all of which are essential for creating immersive experiences in 3d.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond learning the fundamentals of 3d development, this project
            helped me hone my skills with JavaScript, as well as develop a
            deeper appreciation for how code and design can come together to
            create unique interactive experiences.
